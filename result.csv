"I don't know why but often it just doesn't pop up with username and password to fill in my apps and website passwords. And one thing I would truly like to see in this app is to unlock it with a pattern or pincode. But generally otherwise I like the ease of use and the fact that you can also write notes for the particular websites and apps. And I like Avira, having used their products for many years.",Positive
"This app is ok, but it requires a password prior to opening. That's better than trying to remember so many different passwords, but much less convenient than if it just opened whenever you need it. Also, it does not open for every site and is often unable to follow when a new password is needed. The PC version is a bit better than the android version. But, they both need improvement",Positive
"App started out great. Everything that I needed. But after a while passwords would not update across multiple devices. And then when I open the app absolutely no passwords come up, meaning the entire password databases blank. Inexplicable errors that make the entire system unusable unfortunately. I'll probably give it another week to see if the developers fix these issues then I'll simply move to another system. I would be willing to pay for a quality app",Negative
"Okay, there 2 reasons why there is 3 stars here. The first is an issue for those of us who want to lock down sensitive data more than just a password, facial recognition, pattern, or finger print. There is no support for a Yubico dongles and other such keys. The 2nd, and not as important, is support for more browser integration. Because of a lack of browsers that it works with, I have to use Chrome and others like it other wise I don't have that ability to utilize APM to its fullest.",Positive
"The application is the best one so far but there are some issues. It is not working properly sometimes on some specific applications. And also, it is popping up at some applicatios that shouldn't do. At ""Steam"" application, it is popping up at chatbox that you send messages to someone else. Could you please fix the issue? Thank you :) addition2: open avira password manager text pops up almost in every nickname and password textboxes but also in Steam app. Android 9 Xiaomi user",Positive
Edit: lowering my rating only because the app has doesn't play well with Firefox. I normally struggle to use the Avira button in Firefox often giving up and taking back to the copy/paste feature for entering credentials I strongly recommend this app to everyone. There is not a person reading this comment that wouldn't benefit from using Avira Password Manager. Works virtually almost perfectly with all of my apps and sites.,Positive
This app does not mess about. Very accurate and interface friendly. I am at a point that now I cannot do without this kind of interface integration to save 30 odd passwords I have. Any time I need to change a password or get a new one generated this does it seamlessly. Make this one stay please. All my fingers are thumbs up !!,Positive
"Pretty straight forward to use, but, on some apps the auto fill doesn't work, so you have to manually past in the password, and, there is no way (that I know of without premuim) to find out what accounts have been breached/have a bad password, it will only say that an account is breached and than show a blurred icon of the app",Negative
"great when it works, but finicky and frustrating. edit: its finicky and frustrating because the password manager doesn't recognize a lot of fields where i need to put a password in or suggest a strong password and it wont save said strong password, so i have to go into the app instead of just signing in. the mobile version regularly just signs me out every thirty seconds sometimes.",Positive
"I would look somewhere else to store passwords. * passwords dont update across devices * i cant login in this app on android , it keeps saying there is no mobile data, which is absurd. I am also using wifi , same thing. * On the iPhone version, you can log in, but all passwords are blank * On desktop, it's ok. I think It was good before , somewhere you guys are dropping the ball.this app was actually good, and I recommend this like to everyone.",Positive
"Appalling technical support. I got a new device and logged out of my old one. Tried logging into PWM on new device keep getting the error ""no internet connection"". Tried to log into PWM on my old device, to see if that worked. Nope, get the same error. Go through all the usual troubleshooting steps, uninstall, restart device etc etc. Nothing works. So I opened a ticket. Explained the problem and told them all the steps I'd tried. Only to get a generic response asking me to try the same steps",Negative
"Worked fine for a while but for some reason, whenever I type in my master password, it now doesn't let me log in and shows me an error, saying that there's no internet connection even though the internet works just fine for every other app on my phone.",Negative
Great until I changed smartphone. Everytime I try entering the password it says. NO internet connection. Can't find a way of rectify it. No helping hand in ways of support contact. I'll need to cancel and start all over again with another company.,Positive
Excellent password manager! Had a problem with a button constantly on screen. Turned out to be an Android accessibility setting. All is great now!,Positive
They make you to subscribe premium with passwords locked in it . Unable to contact support team unless you're a premium customer. Please don't go for it :( . Review edited,Positive
"The previous app was functional but after the update, I am unable to login in my account, can someone assist with the Password manager for Android",Neutral
"Does everything it promises, across platforms, and free of charge, excellent, what more would you need?... actually, password sharing would be very useful üòâ",Positive
"Hi team, Recently facing issue as not able to login into account. Tried clearing cache,re login into account. It just says preparing password. Please assist",Positive
"This has been my favorite password management tool. However, I was recently forced to relogin and can't get an verification code anymore. I am from Philippines, pls advise.",Positive
The most important thing about an app like these is that is has to work and remember password...after a update it says hey 0 password safed ....what a huge Shi. . Spending now half a day to make everywhere new passwords . Then better write them again on a piece of paper,Positive
It frequently signs out requiring frequent sign in. Being generous with a free services as well as smooth functionality is why I give full 5 ‚≠ê‚ú®‚≠ê,Positive
"From a reputable company, keeps all your passwords accessible everywhere you go across phone to pc. Only wish is that 2fa also saved your codes remotely",Positive
I've been using Avira Password Manager for a few years and I've been quite satisfied with it!,Positive
"Avira is an excellent, easy to use password manager where you can store over 100 passwords for free",Positive
"The app was great before but now I suddenly can't even log in with my master password it keeps saying ""incorrect password"" even tho it is correct",Positive
"App is not working anymore, saying there is no internet connection while every other app has connected fine.",Negative
Full featured and convenient. Works well and does exactly what I need.,Positive
"App was great until a few weeks ago it started CONSTANTLY freezing after logging in. And nothing helps - I tried re-installing it, restarting my phone. It was a little annoying at first, but now it happens half of the times I try to use it. And auto-fill function doesn't work properly - it either doesn't show up at all for some websites or offers to ""save my password"" when I set my alarm clock.",Positive
"I think the best password manager out there. Has 2-way verification that no one else has. also includes a two way verification app so you have 2 apps in one and syncs it on all devices, thats the best. Informs you when a account has been breached (only pro version). The only think that I would like to have is clear the clipboard after a few seconds or minutes. Update Apr 2019: The autofill function is nit working for me. I don't know why. Also the clipboard is not working.",Positive
"Good application. Very useful but sometimes, the fingerprint unlock is not available and I have to use my master password which is quite long and complicated. It is also very difficult to see the difference between the lowercase l and the number 1 when you want to see a password. Autofill feature is annoying take too much space on the screen.",Negative
Doesn't open when you put master password. No error indicating the problem whether the password is wrong or not.,Negative
"Apparently, the avira password manager does not save my passwords for some reason.",Negative
the new update seems to break the app...can't login with all my phones with the latest update.,Neutral
Best Password Manager I have ever used. Also includes 2FA support all in one app.,Positive
The app cannot even reinstall after uninstall. Useless.,Negative
"I had an issue with sign in and syncing passwords between app and browser extension. I emailed them (there is no other way to contact them) and had this reply ""I have checked your email address in our database, and unfortunately I couldn't find any active Avira licenses for this account. Please keep in mind that we can only offer email and telephone support to customers using our premium products."" So unless you buy a license they won't help. I'm ditching for a different app.",Negative
"I really like the idea of this. Sadly, it doesn't do in real life What it does in my head. There's no option to import passwords in the app. I tried logging in to the Web app to see if it was possible there, but it doesn't accept either one of the two passwords required. It won't automatically save any passwords that are autofilled from my browser (firefox) either. I'm not going to be able to commit to copying and pasting every. single. password. into the app - it's just too cumbersome.",Negative
"I am very happy with this password manager, I used a few others before this one.. but I like Avira the best.. the free version here allows me 2 devices connected at the same time.. which is super cool. And the overall user experience is also very smooth. 5 stars would recommend to everyone.",Positive
"update. i changed to other password manager , but i keep coming back for this. this is still much better.",Positive
"Using on Firefox (desktop and mobile) it either doesn't pop up to auto fill at all or there's a very quick Avira pop up that instantly disappears when I tap in the username or password box, either way I always have to navigate away from the browser find avira find the username and password copy them and navigate back to the log in page. It never autofills credit card details either and It also never offers to save new passwords and there's no password generator",Negative
"Needs an auto generator built into the Android app. Also randomly forgets it's logged in and shows a blank list when I tap on the pop-up from my browser. Then when I open the app, it's still logged in, so it wasn't a security timeout.",Negative
"Love the app, but lately it looks up,which is really cumbersome. Since I work in the field of UI/ UX I have detected some small things that could be more consistent and work better. But on average the app is super and I would recommend it to friends.",Positive
"Very useful as password saver and authenticator. It can also be set to autofill apps and webpages with saved accounts. Also generic notes and credit cards can be saved in separate lists, aside from passwords. Would love to see an option for saving accounts linked to say google or facebook, and so having the password field not mandatory; another useful field would be ""account name"", as an optional field between this and email. Thanks for the app.",Positive
"Avira PWM is the best. I can store unlimited number of passwords, unlike other well known password managers. I can log-in to websites AND apps using Avira. Also it syncs across all my devices. It has a password generator. There are note,too. All this completely free. What more can you ask for? Edit: decreased one star because the notes section is buggy. When I press on any part of a note it scrolls to the top. Makes note editing very difficult. Fix it and it'll be five stars again. All the best.",Positive
I've tested a number of psssword managers and Avira is one of the best. Auto fill and sync works well on both Android and Windows. Unlike other free versions there are no limits to the number of log ins you can store. It also as an authentication module for 2FA to save the need for a separate app. Needs a password generator then it'd be 5 stars.,Positive
"Hi. Dear Avira team, help me understand why you are not answering me? I described my problem by email and got a mail from yours with some kind of a service number [7GQ6XE-EE6QM]. I added more info by mail later but still nothing from you.",Positive
"UPDATE on 01-14-2021: The Tablet (which is CHROME browser all the way) experience is a BAD. ...No ""suggest password"" option(browser) ...No landscape support ...No plugin option (i usually use Firefox which is lightyears better than chrome, except on android, which it's generally a trash experience) ...CONSTANTLY have to put in master password and even then, still same OG:Unable to use more than 1 Google account from phone. So no option for business and personal on the same phone. Super annoying",Neutral
"This app is great and very user friendly. I do have one problem, when I remove the check mark from Autofill login in forms to disable it, there is no other option for signing in. Was expecting to just click on the user name and password and the information would be applied. Everything I read says autofill big security problem.",Positive
For some reason the app will not offer to save new password or offer to create new passwords it just throws up this annoying pop-up saying there is no password saved for this site. This frustrating pop-up covers the box where you are to type passwords and it pops up every time you refresh.which is kinda the reason why ICanceled my subscription. If it would at least offer to save the new password that you just created then it wouldn't be so bad. But it doesn't. The pc ver works OK though,Negative
"I am using the PRO version and it lacks a lot of features and already has a lot of issues like: a standalone password suggestion like in Kaspersky, poor password management (PW and usernames can't be saved automatically), You can't suggest a password during a registration .. and many more. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",Negative
"It was working perfectly, today it decided not to allow me to sign in via my fingerprint and when it asks for the master password that is not correct either. Same password I've been using since I set up this app. Now I no longer have access to any of my passwords. This is not acceptable. I m scrambling to figure out 85+ personal and business passwords.",Positive
"The app is inconsistent. I use it on 3 devices, my phone, tablet & laptop. Works pretty well on the laptop but sketchy on the other 2. It often doesn't fill fields, I have to go into the app to use it or just get the info for the account and enter it myself.",Positive
"Avira is hands down the best password app I have used. On most apps after you save a certain number of passwords you have to pay for more but 145+ passwords and still free. There is also a place for secure notes and debit/credit card info. It also has a password generator that allows you to include/exclude uppercase, numbers, special characters and choose length. It also has two-factor authentication for sensitive info apps/websites/email.",Positive
"Not so good. Does not recognize the log in page for several web sites. The passwords generator not always shows up and most of the times it is useless since it doesn't follow the characters allow in each website ergo I end it up creating my own password the majority of times, And sometimes this new password are not saved in the app, you have to enter it manually.... I do not recommend this app at all I think there are much better lotions out there such as dashlane which I will go back soon",Negative
Great little app for storing passwords. Convenient and easy to use. Only minor gripe is that very occasionally (three times over a couple of years) the app wont let me log in and I then have to use the web based version which isn't formatted well for mobile use.,Positive
"I am incredibly grateful that Avira gave us this app to use. It is the best password manager out there without all the bloat functions that come with their competitors. Avira Password Manager is also less than half the price of it's competitors for the premium version. With full zero-knowledge-architecture. Thank you, Avira, for making this world a better place by giving us an amazing free solution too!",Positive
"Very mixed. When it works its great, but the mobile app is frustrating. It seems to offer autofill at random. It doesn't update passwords when they are changed. It's just far too erratic for day to day use. I will uninstall & teplace.",Negative
"App is in general okay, but frequently freezes in the login screen and does not let me type my password. This happened on my Galaxy s6 and Fairphone 3. Also, the autocomplete function sometimes appears as an option and sometimes not. I would give it 5 stars if the login and autocomplete function always worked.",Positive
"None of the Avira products are designed to work with Firefox. Browser autofilli service only works for the data hungry Chrome. Avira antivirus also doesn't protect from phishing websites on Firefox. Uninstalled it and I'm very happy with Bitwarden. Because of companies like Avira, the completion in the web browser market is disappearing. They want to support only the leader but not the savior of the open web, only a looser does it. I'm going to get my refund for Prime membership.",Positive
"One of the few best password managers offers strong pw, warns on the strength of the pw, fingerprint unlock makes accessibility easier. In short it's dependable and safe. Auto filling of pw is still a issue and does not happen all the sites. Otherwise would rate it high among the top five.",Positive
Trying out the free tier of Avira PWM at the moment. I cannot say about others but i personally have liked the experience so far. Auto fill works good with Chrome. I'm assuming it will with Edge Chromium too. Separate toggles for app auto fill and browser auto fill is very much appreciated. Suggestions: 1. The phone apps dont seem to have a password generator and I think a password generator should be added. 2. The cost of the pro subscription seems a bit high (considering Bitwarden's price),Positive
"The service is great on my PC...... I'm an avira Prime user and the app temporarily wouldn't let me log in. Seems everyone was affected. Left a review here like everyone else, Avira responded and a day later the issue was fixed! Best of all my 2FA was saved so I didn't loose anything! Thank you Guys, great service!",Positive
"I'm beginning to feel going with Prime was a mistake. There is no advantage to Prime compared to not having it, you are still nickel and dimed for the apps and services Avira claims you have access to. This app is a great example it's telling me to get pro. What a crock.",Positive
"An excellent password generation and management program. The only complaint I have is that it the auto-fill isn't consistently seamless. Maybe once a week I'll have to copy and paste the password ... but overall, this is an excellent tool and moreover because it is free.",Positive
"This is a really bad app. After losing my main password i re-created my account, on my PC it was no problem to renew the account, but on my mobile device it still asking for security keys, after filling in the key it doesn't accept the keys. What an annoying App. Looking for a mor trustfully password manager this one doesn't work",Negative
Stopped working on android phone. Cannot log in on app but avira password vault does recognize my credentials on a browser with URL. App fails after displaying a captcha message but never displays a captcha challenge. Server just responds invalid email or password. It was great when it was working and way ahead of some other vault offerings for android. Doesn't appear to have a support option on the avira website.,Positive
Could not find any way to import passwords from another program. This makes it useless. I have 234 passwords stored I am not going to input them one by one. 3-4-22 Thanks for your reply but I've moved on to another app. But why wouldn't there be an import function inside the app itself like every other password manager? Who's gonna know to go to the website to do that?,Positive
"So great! Avira's password manager is a game changer! It performs so well and instantly that the task of having to sign in multiple times each day to accounts or apps which was a tedious chore, interrupting my flow, is now completed in seconds by avira pm! Isn't that the way we want every app and piece of tech to actually, improving our experience and productivity? Thanks Avira, R",Positive
My browser extension is working perfectly. Just my app is weird. I am connected with the same account and I have all the passwords. The problem: they don't load and if they do I see only some weird signs so it is not working properly.,Neutral
"Great service ! As a IT geek I really appreciate this service ! It's more safe than actually writing it on a paper and enter the password every time. Because it's easy to log the keyboard without you noticing that at all. This app solves that problem so get it ! German: Gro√üartiger service ! Ich selber bin ausgebildet im IT Bereich und vertraue dieser App all meine Passw√∂rter an. Es verhindert, dass keylogger die das Tastaturfeld dauerhaft scannt und bei dem Hacker als nette Editor Datei ersc.",Positive
"Great service, with many added features. Especially like the password manager which works across all my devices. The antivirus is top of the line. Would reccomend. Long time user for over 10 years.",Positive
This app is terrible compared with Bitwarden which is free. It tells you if your accounts are safe without paying for a subscription. Your app doesn't save password when you change them either. Sometimes it just logs you out for no reason.,Negative
"Great interface and security. However my passwords won't sync between my Macbook and Android device. Would love to change this review if the support team can get in touch, but if the app won't sync then it is essentially pointless",Positive
"I've been using it for ages and its great but suddenly today when I try and log on via my android by the app it keeps trying to bring up a captcha and sends me a code via text but just keeps repeating this, never allowing me to log on until it complains of too many attempts and says try later... Sometimes the captcha shows but most times not, you just see some text re one but no actual captcha.. Now its doing it on the PC..Shows an error 400 which I presume is a page not found..",Negative
"On my phone I show I have 65 p/w, the same as my computer and when I try open all of them it doesn't show anything. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled still the same results. The first time I put it on my phone it worked but somehow it had gotten uninstalled.",Neutral
"One of the password managers that is actually good. I switched from Mcafee Truekey as that wasn't working out for me so I decided to look for a new pw manager and this one caught my eye so I tried it out, now its my main pw manager (even for my laptop). Autofill is great, UI is easy to use, Security is strong and it's just 10/10.",Positive
Underrated app with comprehensive free version. My sole qualm is it only provides an autofill service and most Android browsers have really bad autofill API integration. That isn't really Avira's fault but other password managers solve this issue through an additional accessibility service.,Positive
The app randomly signs me out. Like it resets itself. This has happened 3 or 4 times this year. It is incredibly frustrating and inconvenient. I don't understand why. Is otherwise a fairly solid app in my experience.,Negative
Great on a laptop. I like being able to lock the passwords and having to sign-in again as passwords are important enough to warrant constant awareness. The auto filling of log in details on the mobile doesn't always work.,Positive
"Great. However... after going to ultra power saving mode in a Samsung device and going back, the Avira PM requests to enable it in services etc. despite it's already priviliged - so I need to disable it an then enable again. Observed on M51 and Tab S6 Lite Happens each time.",Positive
Installation and registration for this app on my laptop was easy ... But inexplicably the playstore version for Android took forever to download ... The laptop version often makes errors when saving details of multiple accounts from the same provider (eg: gmail) ... So be careful to double-check what exactly is being saved!,Positive
"I can't even login with my Google account. I've uninstalled reinstalled app numerous times to no avail. My 4 star review went down to a 1-star. UPDATE: The latest update has fixed the app. Web version of the app needs to be more mobile friendly, which was what I used in the meantime of not having this app function. Thanks for listening to your reviewers and coming with a swift fix.",Positive
"As a long-time Avira Prime user, for some reason, I appear to have a login issue with Avira Password Manager. I presume this to be a reoccuring problem, because, this is not the first time that I have come to find myself trying to solve it. Is there a known issue thay is same or similar to the one that I described above?",Negative
"Password manager not restoring paid subscription of which I have on my PC (Prime) and on mobile via another Avira product I'm not paying 3 times... Edit:- After a few emails I had it sorted, uninstalled app and re-installed the paid version was available, thank you Avira Customer Services!!",Positive
"2.10 have bug,it show prepare your password angin and angin, can't login",Neutral
Doesn't work for me as the free version cuts the URLs short the the main domain and extension. As a technician user I have a list of subdomain access with different logins. I contact support by Feedback and that leads to the Google play appstore.,Positive
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I can't access my password manager because I don't receive the verification code sent to my registered phone number after numerous ""resend code"". There is no alternative means of verification. It is an ongoing issue for 3 days now. My registered phone number is still very much active as I receive calls and messages on it. Avira I need my password manager account back so I can back up my passwords elsewhere.",Negative
"One day I opened the App, and ALL my info was gone",Neutral
I used to be a ironvst user but I started using APM because its much better than ironvest.. however its such a shame that I dont know about Avira password manager sooner. Been using Avira service for antivirus since 2008. . Thank you for this app.. The perk using this app is they APM may tell you if your account have been breached and advice you to change your password.,Positive
It is very useful and really secure. The msot thing I like about this app that it is work on any device you have and sync across all of your devices. Also the free version is more than enough.,Positive
"Coming from Avira, I had high expectations for this app. It turned out to be a huge disappointment. Has fewer features than others password managers that are free. The UI is nice though.",Positive
Repeatedly have to sign in. Too many times.,Neutral
"Junk. Different behaviour on every platform, especially terrible on Android managing logins, new accounts and passwords is especially a chore between apps and websites. Choose something else. The iOS version has a good UX Why don't you just replicate that one?",Negative
"I have been using the app for a decent amount of time until today where I instantly uninstalled it. It was the one and only place where I saved my info. Today my amazon account ( the hacker decided to get himself a gift card), discord, Facebook, Instagram, and twitter got hacked and my Instagram's password literally got changed in both the app and in the avira ""password manager""app. Anyways, I hope no one faces that where I had to apologise to almost everyone I know. I couldn't rate 0.",Positive
"I've subscribed for AVIRA PRIME and loved it very much. What captivates me is the Avira Password Manager, where I don't have to remember or write down all the passwords which redious and troublesome. TQ keep it up.",Positive
"Good Product, Not compatible with KeePass. It would be great to open a KeePass DB and populate this password manager. No Credit Card option neither. Sophos can do all this but It is in the UK and they are not so strict with Data Protection laws like Germany.",Positive
"The only app that I need for authentication, for me is not MFA is APM-FA. Maximum qualification.",Neutral
"Great service, but the app is stuck in a log in loop after sms two factor authentication. Update: Unable to get support without paying for a premium license.",Positive
I cant login to desktop web browser giving me an unkown error. Tried changing password via finger print enabled mobile app and getting a connection error after clicking change master password... Now it suggests to forget all creds.,Negative
"I cant even type my master password in the entrance page EDIT: Sorry I deleted all of my Avira accounts because the Antivirus added the password manager in my browser. I didnt want the password manager actually and also I gave it a try on mobile if it works. My problem is, What if you got hacked and hackers deleted all the data in your servers(If you claim for encryption so they cant read it)? I have been using Google Password manager from the beginning and Google cant be hacked. So I should stick to it. And it works on mobile without installing any apps and it is inbuilt in chrome and Android.",Negative
